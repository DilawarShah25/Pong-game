This code implements a simple Pong game using Python's Turtle module for graphics and user input handling. Here's an overview of the main components and concepts used:

1. **Turtle Graphics**: The Turtle module provides a simple way to create graphics and animations in Python.

2. **Classes and Inheritance**: The code utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts by defining classes for the scoreboard, ball, and paddles. Inheritance is used to create specialized objects with shared properties and methods.

3. **Time Module**: The `time.sleep()` function is used to control the speed of the ball's movement.

4. **Game Loop**: The game loop (`while game_is_on`) continuously updates the screen and checks for user input and collisions.

5. **Collision Detection**: The code detects collisions between the ball and the walls, as well as collisions with the paddles. When a collision occurs, appropriate actions are taken, such as bouncing the ball off the walls or paddles, updating the scoreboard, and resetting the ball's position.

6. **User Input Handling**: The `screen.listen()` function is used to enable keyboard input, and the `screen.onkey()` function assigns specific functions to keyboard keys to control the paddles.

7. **Scoring**: The scoreboard keeps track of the scores for both players and updates the display accordingly.

Here's a breakdown of the classes used in the code:

- **Scoreboard**: Manages the display of scores for both players.

- **Ball**: Represents the ball in the game. It handles its movement, bouncing off walls and paddles, and resetting its position.

- **Paddle**: Represents the paddles controlled by the players. It handles their movement up and down.

Overall, the code demonstrates a simple implementation of the classic Pong game, showcasing fundamental concepts of Python programming, including classes, inheritance, and event handling.
